# openwifimap-html5

OpenWiFiMap is a database and map for free network WiFi routers (freifunk and others, too!). 

This is a HTML5 map app with data from a [OpenWiFiMap database](http://github.com/freifunk/openwifimap-api/).

## HTML5 app installations

As currently there is no working database-backend, all maps are offline / non functional also. See https://github.com/freifunk/openwifimap-api/issues/9 for some additional details.

## Submitting and querying data

If you want to submit nodes to the database or if you want to query the database, please take a look at the [OpenWiFiMap API documentation](https://github.com/freifunk/openwifimap-api/blob/master/API.md).
